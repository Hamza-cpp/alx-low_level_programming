# Preprocessor
In C programming, the preprocessing step is the first phase of compiling a C program. During the preprocessing step, the C preprocessor performs various tasks on the source code before it is compiled into object code.

The following tasks are performed during the preprocessing step:

Directive Processing: The C preprocessor processes preprocessor directives, which are commands that start with a # symbol. These directives are used to include header files, define macros, and perform conditional compilation.

Macro Expansion: Macros are a way of defining a shortcut for a piece of code or a value. During the preprocessing step, the preprocessor replaces all occurrences of macro names with their corresponding definitions.

File Inclusion: The #include directive is used to include a header file in a C program. During the preprocessing step, the preprocessor replaces the #include directive with the contents of the specified header file.

Conditional Compilation: Preprocessor directives like #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #elif, and #else are used to conditionally compile parts of a program based on compile-time conditions.

Line Control: The #line directive is used to change the line number and file name that appear in error messages and debug information.

After the preprocessing step is complete, the resulting source code is passed on to the compilation step, where it is translated into object code by the C compiler. The output of the preprocessing step is not a complete executable program, but rather a modified version of the original source code that has been prepared for compilation.
# Compiler
In C programming, the compilation step is the second phase of compiling a C program, which comes after the preprocessing step. During the compilation step, the C compiler translates the preprocessed source code into object code, which is a binary representation of the program that can be executed by the computer.

The following tasks are performed during the compilation step:

Syntax Checking: The compiler checks the syntax of the preprocessed source code to ensure that it conforms to the rules of the C language. If there are any syntax errors, the compiler will produce an error message and stop the compilation process.

Type Checking: The compiler checks the types of all variables and expressions in the source code to ensure that they are used correctly. If there are any type errors, the compiler will produce an error message and stop the compilation process.

Code Generation: The compiler generates object code for the program based on the preprocessed source code. The object code is a binary representation of the program that can be executed by the computer.

Optimization: The compiler may perform optimization on the object code to improve the performance of the program. Optimization can include techniques such as constant folding, loop unrolling, and code reordering.

After the compilation step is complete, the resulting object code is passed on to the linking step, where it is combined with other object code files and libraries to create a complete executable program. The output of the compilation step is an object file with a .o extension, which contains the compiled code for the corresponding source file.
