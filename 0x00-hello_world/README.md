# Preprocessor
In C programming, the preprocessing step is the first phase of compiling a C program. During the preprocessing step, the C preprocessor performs various tasks on the source code before it is compiled into object code.

The following tasks are performed during the preprocessing step:

Directive Processing: The C preprocessor processes preprocessor directives, which are commands that start with a # symbol. These directives are used to include header files, define macros, and perform conditional compilation.

Macro Expansion: Macros are a way of defining a shortcut for a piece of code or a value. During the preprocessing step, the preprocessor replaces all occurrences of macro names with their corresponding definitions.

File Inclusion: The #include directive is used to include a header file in a C program. During the preprocessing step, the preprocessor replaces the #include directive with the contents of the specified header file.

Conditional Compilation: Preprocessor directives like #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #elif, and #else are used to conditionally compile parts of a program based on compile-time conditions.

Line Control: The #line directive is used to change the line number and file name that appear in error messages and debug information.

After the preprocessing step is complete, the resulting source code is passed on to the compilation step, where it is translated into object code by the C compiler. The output of the preprocessing step is not a complete executable program, but rather a modified version of the original source code that has been prepared for compilation.
